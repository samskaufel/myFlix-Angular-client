# MyFlixAngularClient

## Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3.

Using Angular, I built the client-side for an application called "myFlix" based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database). 

## Objective
This project allowed me to gain experience using Angular to build a similar client-side interface I previously built with React.

## Features
- Displays a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account
- Displays a list of 10 movies 
- Each movie card contains a button to show the movie description, genre information, and director information, as well as a favorite button 
- A profile view where users can view their information
- A favorites view where users can view and remove their favorites

## Built Using
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- Angular
- Node.js
- Documentation generated with TypeDoc

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
